Please check out my <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-westgate-88362045/>LinkedIn</a> profile for a full list of experiences, or keep on reading to find out more about me.</p><p>As the driving founder of <a href=https://www.green-hippo.com/>Green Hippo Ltd</a> I had the privilege to work with some awesome people over the years. They have taught me a lot during the 20 years building the business from a tiny office in Tottenham to a 30 strong team with worldwide distribution and a market leading product.
As a founder it is often tough to keep track of all the things that need doing, from day-to-day cashflow management to strategic planning, to building a strong brand and company culture. Oh, yes, not to forget to drive your product forward and look after your customers! Drop one ball, and it can be a real set-back. One of the key decisions we made during our growth was to bring on NEDs - Non-Executive Directors. It was invaluable to get honest feedback from experienced practitioners, enabling you to step outside the business and have a critical look at where your business is heading. Now that Green Hippo has found a new home with <a href=https://tvone.com/>tvONE</a> as parent company, I am interested in working with the next generation of disruptive ideas, supporting young founders on their journey to grow their businesses.</p><p>Next to building teams and businesses bringing new ideas to life, I have a real passion for technology. With a track record in high performance video playback and processing, I am turning towards the newer fields of data processing, machine learning and AI. Working with the team at <a href=https://www.citilogik.com/>Citi Logik</a> in Leeds, I was able to help restructure their data processing work and bring software engineering practices to a team predominantly made up of Data Analysts. This meant creating processing templates to port their SQL algorithms to pySpark to speed up and parallelise processing of billions of events running on clusters in the cloud. We also added an automated testing system and combined JupyterLab based exploration with production ready and testable modules.</p><p>I am continuing my exploration of these new technologies, as the areas of machine learning and AI will be instrumental in shaping our future. It is imperative that we step into this bright new world with eyes wide open and a sense of critical understanding, putting us humans first.</p></div></section></article><footer id=footer><ul class=icons><li><a href=mailto:sean@pickle-juice.co.uk class="icon fa-envelope-o"><span class=label>Email</span></a></li></ul><ul class=copyright><li>&copy; 2022 picklejuice</li><li>Design: <a href=http://html5up.net>HTML5 UP</a></li></ul></footer></div><script src=/js/bundle.min.e782e74b6a26b3617d7b8d54226975384ec8c8ea308372a74df0ab1963ec7e41b87330abd1910eec69ef09bdf08a12bf1bcb5321cc4077c8d0a6c00825fc56b5.js integrity="sha512-54LnS2oms2F9e41UIml1OE7IyOowg3KnTfCrGWPsfkG4czCr0ZEO7GnvCb3wihK/G8tTIcxAd8jQpsAIJfxWtQ=="></script></body></html>
