&lt;p>MkDoc Maker is an AI-powered markdown writing assistant designed to help you create high-quality technical documentation faster. It leverages the latest LLMs(large Language Models) to extract information from various sources, including technical documents, images, and even your own messy notes, and then uses this information to generate well-structured and informative content.&lt;/p>

While it can&amp;rsquo;t write the final version for you, it can significantly speed up your workflow by providing ideas, frameworks, and suggestions to work with.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://picklejuicedev.github.io/aboutme/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 14:07:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://picklejuicedev.github.io/aboutme/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="sean-westgate">Sean Westgate&lt;/h2>
